Student Performance Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data from theory and practical exams using deep learning (MLP). It aims to identify factors affecting student outcomes and predict pass/fail results based on demographics, parental education, test preparation, and exam scores.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?resource=download

Records: 1000 students, 15+ features

Target: Pass/Fail based on average score ≥ 60

Objectives

Explore and visualize student performance patterns

Preprocess data: encode, normalize, split

Build and train an MLP model to predict outcomes

Evaluate model with accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC

Generate actionable insights for educators

Key Insights

Test preparation and higher parental education improve scores

Female students slightly outperform in reading and writing

Math, reading, and writing scores are strongly correlated

MLP model achieves ~88% accuracy and high AUC


Future Scope

Include additional features like attendance or study hours

Predict exact scores using regression models

Apply advanced models (CNN, LSTM) or explainable AI (SHAP/LIME)
